# LocalSearch


## Description
Implementation of Local Search to solve **diagonal magic cube of 5\*5\*5 dimension** using OOP-like paradigm.

The implemented algorithm are:
- Steepest Ascent Hill-climbing
- Hill-climbing with Sideways Move
- Random Restart Hill-climbing, using
        Steepest Ascent Hill-climbing
        Hill-climbing with Sideways Move

- Stochastic Hill-climbing
- Simulated Annealing
- Genetic Algorithm
